# Quick Tuto: Gradio Package

Welcome to the **Quick Tuto** repository! This project provides an introduction to the **Gradio** package, which simplifies the creation of user-friendly interfaces for machine learning models, data science experiments, and more.

## What is Gradio?

**Gradio** is a Python library that allows you to:

- Quickly create interactive UIs for your models or data pipelines.
- Share your interfaces via public links.
- Integrate seamlessly with your Python code.

Gradio is perfect for:

- Testing machine learning models interactively.
- Sharing demos with collaborators.
- Building interfaces for non-technical users.

## Repository Structure

- **`gradio app/tut_*`**: Contains practical examples of Gradio applications.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the tutorial.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies to install.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yasahiro10/gradioapp_tuto.git
   cd gradio app
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running an Example

1. Navigate to the `gradio app/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd gradio app/tut_{}
   ```

2. Run an example script:

   ```bash
   python tut_1.py
   ```

3. Open the Gradio interface in your browser. You will see a local or public URL in the terminal.

## Key Features of Gradio

1. **Customizable Components**: Build interfaces with input and output components like text boxes, sliders, images, and more.
2. **Easy Sharing**: Generate shareable links to your app with one command.
3. **Fast Prototyping**: Design interfaces in just a few lines of code.

## Example Code

Here is a simple Gradio example:

```python
import gradio as gr

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

iface = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="text", outputs="text")
iface.launch()
```
